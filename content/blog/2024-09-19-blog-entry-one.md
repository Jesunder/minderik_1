I’m Erik, a multi-disciplinary designer with a passion for creating compelling visual and functional experiences. My skills range from mastering Adobe Creative Suite to programming and 3D modeling. I’ve completed several internships with Ramdesign and Triple Click Studio, where I honed my craft and gained hands-on experience in the design industry.

<br>

As a hard worker, I strive to deliver results in everything I do, constantly learning and improving my techniques to stay ahead of trends and meet clients' needs. My design philosophy revolves around blending creativity with practicality, ensuring that every project not only looks good but works seamlessly.
