## What is it about?

For our assignment we are creating a museums catologus for the exhibition ”Onderkruipsels” at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Alongside of this we were provided a large digital archive from the musuem it self that gave us high quality images. We choose our own format, proportions, number of pages and fonts keeping in mind the context of the exhibition. Therefore the aim is for a comfortable and enjoyable readability.

# **Project: Typography**
---

## What is it about?

The first week we have gotten a introduction into typography, we received information about the various lettertypes, sorts (cursive, italic, capital), the weights letterwidth and so on. An extensive yet an easy to understand lecture. The main task is to make an design orientated on typography and to use all the principles shown by Johan.We all received a lottery for a ticket that gave us a quote. This quote became the main attention of the design. We would also need to add Biography and the source to the design. Although we would also make this not only on one medium but rather 4 different ones. Those being: Poster, Book, Slideshow, Instagram poster. We have to respect the medium but also the readability of the text. On top of it the design should be able to be recognized in each individual medium.
