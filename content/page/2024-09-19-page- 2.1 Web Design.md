#  **Project: XD Prototyping**
---

## What is it about?

In our semester, we decided to ignore the production phase in favor of fine-tuning the Design phase. In part 5 of the Design phase, we are intended to make a working prototype using XD as our tool, both for the Desktop and Phone versions. However, during the prototype production and additional testing, I made changes to the Visual Design elements of the website, which will be mentioned.

The goal of the prototype is to give as real a feel as possible of the website to the client and showcase how all the working elements will fit together. This not only gives your client or public a testing ground for suggestions and improvements but also serves as the base on which you can start the production phase.
